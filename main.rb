# 1. Add a new file in helpers/session.rb (make sure it's linked up in main)
#    -- Create a method for is_logged_in?
#    -- Replace in index.erb with the method
# 2. Replace our Welcome, user_id, with Welcome, email!
#    -- Create a method in helpers/session.rb
#    -- current_user
#    -- -- look up the user in the database based on session[:user_id]
#           (add find_user_by_id method in the user model)
#    -- -- Return nil if there is no user
# 3. Add a logout button that makes a `delete request` to `/sessions`
#    -- in sessions controller
#    -- set sessions[:user_id] = nil
